**Description**: 
Collision Clones is a game with moving cars of different sizes and colors, 
whose objective is to move the red car, by your mouse cursor, within the time limit with few collisions.
If the red car is hit, it changes the color and size. 
In order to revive it, move the cursor to one of the borders of the diagram. 
You loose if the number of collisions is greater than the time in seconds.
After a certain number of collisions, clone cars appear.
