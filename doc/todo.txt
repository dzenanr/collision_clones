To do

+ check the rapid increase in collisions (only when the red car is small)
+ check the red car position when far south and east
+ check car collisions for better avoidance
+ every 1 minute if you have less than 10 collisions you get a GitHub badge
+ use images for cars
+ rotate a car to follow its move direction
+ parametrize when a new car will appear after a certain number of collisions
+ parametrize the number of cars
+ parametrize the size of cars  
+ change cars to clouds; change the red car to a (hot air) balloon
